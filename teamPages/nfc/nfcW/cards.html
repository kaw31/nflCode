<!-- ============  INTRO  ============== -->
    <div id="teamCont">
        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States. The team was established in Chicago in 1898 and joined the NFL as a charter member in 1920. Along with the Chicago Bears, the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league's founding. The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987. Before the 1988 season, the team moved west to Tempe, Arizona, a college suburb east of Phoenix, and were known as the Phoenix Cardinals, before finally changing their name to the now Arizona Cardinals in 1994. The Crds are the oldest team to have never one a Super bowl, and have only ever appeared in one in 2008.
            <br>
            <br>The Cardinals had a fairly disappointing season last year, finishing with a record of 7-8-1, and missing out on the playoffs. The team is running out of time to make a Super Bowl run, with an aging offence. However, there is still enough talent throughout this team, and Bruce Arians is considered to be one of the better coaches in the league, so maybe they have enough juice left to put together a good run.</p>
        </div>
        
<!-- ============  ROSTER  ============== -->

                </div>
                    <h3>Head Coach: Bruce Arians</h3>
                    <p>The window to compete for a championship is quickly closing in the desert. It may be now or never for the Cardinals, who rely heavily on two veterans seemingly on the verge of retirement. Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald both considered walking away from the game this past offseason. Head coach Bruce Arians must maximize their final year(s), and he can do so with running back David Johnson as the offensive focal point. The defense is also one of the league's most flexible with multiple hybrid defenders. Calais Campbell's departure in free agency shouldn't be overlooked, though. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="offenceCont">
                <div class="offenceBg headBgImgs">
                    <h2>OFFENCE</h2>
                </div>
                     <p>Arizona finished in the top 10 for total yards, passing yards and points scored. They just need to improve the running attack, having finished just 19th in rushing yards. Although the team has one of the best runners in the game in David Johnson, they rely far too heavily on him, and need to take some of the pressure off him. Carson Palmer is still productive in his twilight years, and has nice targets in franchise legend Larry Fitzgerald and John Brown. but you have to wonder how much is left for Palmer. The aging QB won't be the answer for much longer, so the team will definitely have to start planning for life without him sooner than later.</p> 
            </div>

                    <h2>DEFENCE</h2>
                </div>
                    <p>The Crds have one of the best defences in the game, which was evidence with them finishing 2nd overall in total defence. They have one of the best secondaries in the league, with superstars at both corner in Patrick Peterson, and at safety in Tyrann Mathieu. They have a great core of linebacker with Karlos Dansby, Chandler jones, and rookie Haason Reddick. The big question mark will be who can replace their fromer star DE Calais Campbell, who jumped ship to the Jaguars. Robert Nkemdiche has been a disappointment so far, but cards fans will be hoping for a breakout year from the aggressive d-lineman.

                    <h3>David Johnson, RB</h3>
                        <p>Although Larry Fitzgerald has been the face of the franchise for what seems like forever, he's no longer the teams best player, ever since David Johnson burst onto the scene. Johnsons came out of nowhere when the Cardinals decided to start him with 5 games to go in his rookie season two years ago. He exploded straight into stardom and hasn't looked back. Last year, in his second season, he was named 1st team All Pro and was selected to the pro bowl.
                        <br><br>Johnson is one of the most exciting players in the game, and many already consider him to be the best running back in the league. It may be too early to crown him the game's best back, but he sure isn't far off. Johnson has so much speed and power, and is just as effective in the passing game as he is running. Whenever he has the ball in his hands, look out.</p>
